want to classify google image search results for artist name into different categories:

artwork (of that artist) - include altered artwork? (photoshopped, parodies?)
photo of the artist
both (for example artist posing next to artwork)
ambiguous (self-portraits)
other/unrelated
temporarily unable to classify



Interpretation unclear. Narcissism? Sexism? Type of art?
Problem: extract effect of advent of photography obviously
